## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- DOM
- Dummy Datas
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Transition/ Animation


### What I learned
<!-- - Strengthen my knowledge on BEM pattern for naming convention.
- Understand the trick of min css property and minmax() with grid Css
- Enhance my css positioning skills and usage of pseudo elements -->


### Continued development
- scroll animation
- fading with intersection observer
- DOM
<!-- - Css positioning and pseudo element
- Responsiveness (fluid spacing, layout and fluid font size).  -->

### Useful resources

[aria-current](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-current) - This helped to achieve setting/representing  the current item. e.g To show active nav link.
[fading up sections using intersection-observer](https://dev.to/jslim/fading-up-sections-using-intersection-observer-3fhj)
[Fixed Vs Sticky Position](https://www.kevinpowell.co/article/positition-fixed-vs-sticky/)
[filter in css](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/filter/) - This helped to achieve img grayscale.

<!-- - [A Deep Dive Into CSS Grid minmax()]() - This helped me  to achieve a 3 column responsive layout with 3 lines of code. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Background position]() - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand to position bg images in x and y axis. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. -->
