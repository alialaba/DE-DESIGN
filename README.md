## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
<!-- - Strengthen my knowledge on BEM pattern for naming convention.
- Understand the trick of min css property and minmax() with grid Css
- Enhance my css positioning skills and usage of pseudo elements -->


### Continued development
- scroll animation
- fading with intersection observer
<!-- - Css positioning and pseudo element
- Responsiveness (fluid spacing, layout and fluid font size).  -->

### Useful resources

<!-- - [A Deep Dive Into CSS Grid minmax()]() - This helped me  to achieve a 3 column responsive layout with 3 lines of code. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Background position]() - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand to position bg images in x and y axis. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. -->
